# SKY Add-ins

SKY Add-ins enable developers to build complementary features that integrate deeply within the user interface of Blackbaud solutions. With add-ins, developers can use familiar web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to augment selected areas of the product with new functionality. Add-ins run in the browser, so they work well in both desktop and mobile scenarios.
